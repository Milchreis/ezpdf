# ezpdf - Changing PDF pages made easy
> I developed *ezpdf* to make simple changes to PDF files without having to install software, use expensive tools like Acrobat Pro or upload files to unknown services. Now you can also use it ðŸ˜Š

You can use EZPDF directly from the [github repo online](https://milchreis.github.io/ezpdf/src/index.html) or download/clone the project and open the index.html in your favorite browser (please not the old IE's ðŸ˜›).
